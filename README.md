# Arduino-Maze-Solving-Robot
Welcome, I'm Siddharth and this is my first robot "Lexus v1.0".  This Robot was designed to solve a simple Maze.  In the competition we had two mazes and the robot was designed to able to identify them and solve both.  Any changes in the maze may need changes in the code or the design but it's easy to do.
